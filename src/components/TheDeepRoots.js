            The Deep Roots Ensemble merges classical chamber music
            instrumentation and techniques with American folk performance
            practice into a refined and cohesive style. It was formed in 2015 by
            Taylor Ackley and Alison Rowe with the goal of bringing the rich
            tradition of music making into concert halls and academic settings.
            Since then they have performed extensively in the New York area, the
            Midwest and the Pacific Northwest along with giving lecture
            recitals, workshops and masterclasses. Their debut album Songs from
            the Bitterroot was released in 2018 through the 4Tay Records label
            and their next album Hard Tellinâ€™ is scheduled for release in late
            2020.
