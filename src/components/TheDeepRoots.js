            The Deep Roots Ensemble performs traditional repertoire and original
            music which reflect the historical diversity and continuing
            creativity of folk music practices in the United States. Their style
            blends classical chamber music instrumentation and techniques with
            traditional American music performance practice and jazz
            improvisation into a refined and cohesive approach to making music.
            This results in an artistic output which is highly innovative while
            remaining familiar and relatable to audiences with a wide range of
            tastes. Their first album Songs from the Bitterroot was financed
            through a social media, crowdfunding campaign and got them signed to
            the 4Tay Records label. In their latest release, Hard Tellinâ€™, The
            Deep Roots Ensemble builds upon the sound heard in first album, but
            expands its instrumental and creative scope. Exploring themes of
            love, family, sin and salvation, Hard Tellin', captures a more
            developed and intricate approach to American roots music.
