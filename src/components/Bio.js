          Taylor Ackley is first and foremost a folk musician. Born into a
          working class family with a remarkable heritage of traditional
          American music, his work grows directly out of the rich musical
          expression cultivated across the generations of pickers, singers, song
          writers and fiddlers that populate his family tree. His academic
          training began at Adelphi University where he studied classical vocal
          performance, jazz bass and composition with Sidney Boquiren,
          Christopher Lyndon-Gee and Paul Moravec. Taylor is currently a
          graduate student at Stony Brook University, where he has studied
          composition with Ray Anderson, Perry Goldstein, Margaret Schedel,
          Daria Semegen and Daniel Weymouth. Along with his substantial success
          as a multi-instrumentalist, Taylor has been commissioned by a number
          of soloists, chamber ensembles, choirs and jazz bands. His music has
          been featured in festivals throughout the United States as well as
          Denmark and China.

          Taylor has composed large catalogue of original works, which explore
          the various expressive languages he has learned from his wide range of
          musical experiences. This has led to a recent compositional output
          which simultaneously liberates and challenges musicians through a
          unique combination of aural transmission, guided improvisation and
          nontraditional notation coupled with an intense reliance on the
          performerâ€™s own ears. He is the founder and director of the Stony
          Brook Roots Ensemble, a chamber music group which focuses on studying
          and performing Traditional American Music. Their debut album Songs
          from the Bitterroot, features all original music and is released by
          4Tay records.
